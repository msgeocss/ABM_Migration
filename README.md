# ABM_Migration_SpringSim2020
An Agent-based model exploring migration patterns

##Overview
This model was developed to explore the impact of different U.S. policy scenarios on the decision making processes and patterns representing migration movement of migrants heading to the U.S. southern border via Mexico. The model was developed using Netlogo 6.1.0. The paper and model will be presented at and published in the proceedings from the <a href="https://scs.org/springsim/"> SpringSim 2020 conference</a> scheduled for 19 May 2020.

The code for the model can be downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/msgeocss/ABM_Migration_SpringSim2020/model/">https://github.com/msgeocss/ABM_Migration_SpringSim2020/model/ </a> and can be run using the free opensource software modeling packagage <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">Netlogo</a>. The model is packaged as a zip file that needs to be extracted. The zip file contains the model (.nlogo) and a folder (data) with the GIS map layers used by the model.

##Abstract
Migration to the United States (U.S.) has been an ongoing topic in the political discourse. In the spe-cific case of migration using the United States-Mexico border, it is difficult to understand the pat-terns and uncertainty that comes from trying to capture the behavior of individuals and groups. Mi-grants using the U.S.-Mexico border present features and migration patterns that are unique, particu-larly in the case of group migrations, structured social networks, and caravans that travel towards the border together. We build an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates migrant decision-making of which border to choose, to test the effects of social influence on an agentâ€™s migration strategy, as well as the effects of policy changes on migrant behavior. Deciphering these emerging patterns of migration and social phenomena can help provide researchers and policymakers with an added di-mension of knowledge on how to better utilize resources at the U.S. ports of entry.
