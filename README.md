# ABM_Migration_SpringSim2020
An Agent-based model to explore impacts of policy decisions on migration.

<h2>Overview</h2>
This model was developed to explore the impacts of U.S. border-policy scenarios and to represent the decision-making and communication processes of migrants as they head to the U.S. southern border via Mexico. The model and associated paper will be presented at and published in the proceedings for the <a href="https://scs.org/springsim/"> SpringSim 2020 conference</a>, scheduled for 19 May 2020. See the reference to the paper at the bottom of this page.

The model was developed in 2019 using Netlogo 6.1.0. The code for the model can be downloaded from here at <a href="https://github.com/msgeocss/ABM_Migration_SpringSim2020/model.zip">https://github.com/msgeocss/ABM_Migration_SpringSim2020/ABM_migration_springsim2020_model.zip </a>. The model is packaged as a zip file that needs to be extracted. The zip file contains the model (.nlogo) and a folder (data) containing the GIS map layers used by the model. The model can be run using the free opensource software modeling packagage <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">Netlogo</a>.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
Migration to the United States (U.S.) has been an ongoing topic in the political discourse. In the specific case of migration using the United States-Mexico border, it is difficult to understand the pat-terns and uncertainty that comes from trying to capture the behavior of individuals and groups. Migrants using the U.S.-Mexico border present features and migration patterns that are unique, particularly in the case of group migrations, structured social networks, and caravans that travel towards the border together. We build an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates migrant decision-making of which border to choose, to test the effects of social influence on an agentâ€™s migration strategy, as well as the effects of policy changes on migrant behavior. Deciphering these emerging patterns of migration and social phenomena can help provide researchers and policymakers with an added dimension of knowledge on how to better utilize resources at the U.S. ports of entry.
